# SprintPay
The Sprint Mesa Toll System
The SprintPay system is an automation of one of the toll booths so you can pass through the toll without having to stop.

This system is for the map [Sprint Mesa](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776159217)

## Requirements
You need the following addons to use the SprintPay system:
[Sprops](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)
[Wiremod](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)
[Advanced Duplicator 2](steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)

## Installation
After subscribing to all the required addons, download the repo zip file.
Open the zip file and copy the "garrysmod" folder to your "/steamapps/Garry's Mod" folder.

## Duping
In the AdvDupe2 menu, you should see a folder called "sprint2" then a folder called "sprintpay" and inside it, a file called "sprint2_sprintpay_system".
Select it and make sure to select the checkbox "paste at original position".
Now spawn it and check the toll for a red rectangle area. This is the detection area for the chip you will install.

## Wiring Toll Gates
After pasting the dupe, you will see a Expression2 chip below the window of the booth of the red rectangular area, on both sides.
Using the wire tool, wire the inputs "Open" and "Close" to the respective expression2's outputs "Open" and "Close".
Repeat this steps with the other toll booth and you're done.

## Placing on Your Car
At the entrance door of the toll booth, you will see a small ATM like contraption.
Press "E" on the screen to spawn your card and weld it to your vehicle.
You must weld it on your base/car. If you use the parent tool the card will not be detected by the system.
